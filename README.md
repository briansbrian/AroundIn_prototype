## Overview

AroundIn is a hyperlocal marketplace web application that helps customers discover nearby shops, products, and services. The app offers both customer and vendor experiences â€” customers can search and browse local listings and vendors can manage their shops and products. The frontend is built with Vite + React and styled with Tailwind (via CDN in index.html).
